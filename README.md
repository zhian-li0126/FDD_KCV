# FDD_KCV
This is a project to use K-fold cross-validation for our [FDD paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168169925006507?dgcid=coauthor#f0005).
The final results are located in "data/result" in the form of csv file, recorded the accuracy and loss of each fold in repeats regarding training and validation.

To install the required dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run the main pipeline script, execute:
